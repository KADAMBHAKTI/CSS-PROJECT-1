    <dl style="width: 80%; margin: auto;">
        <dt style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 40px; color: blue;">Introduction</dt>
        <dd style="font-size: 20px;">India, often referred to as a “young nation,” boasts a significant demographic dividend. Nearly 65% of its population is under the age of 35, making youth a critical segment of the nation’s population. This essay delves into understanding the role, challenges, and potential of the youth in contemporary India.</dd>

        <dt style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 40px; color: blue; padding-top: 1%;">The Role of Youth in India</dt>
        <dd style="font-size: 20px;">The youth of India play a pivotal role in the nation’s development. As the torchbearers of change, they are the driving force behind innovation, entrepreneurship, and technological advancements. Their energy, creativity, and dynamism contribute to the socio-economic development of the country. They are not just the future of India, but their active participation in the present is shaping India’s trajectory towards becoming a global powerhouse.</dd>

        <dt style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 40px; color: blue; padding-top: 1%;">Challenges Faced by Indian Youth</dt>
        <dd style="font-size: 20px;">Despite their potential, Indian youth face numerous challenges. Unemployment and underemployment remain significant issues. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the unemployment rate among Indian youth was around 23% in 2020. This is a substantial concern as it leads to a waste of valuable human resources. <br>Education is another area of concern. While enrolment rates in primary education have improved, the quality of education and the high dropout rates in secondary and higher education are worrying. This results in a skills gap, where the youth are either under-skilled or not skilled in areas that are in demand in the job market.</dd>

        <dt style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: 500; line-height: 40px; color: blue; padding-top: 1%;">Conclusion</dt>
        <dd style="font-size: 20px;">The youth of India hold the key to the country’s future. Their energy, creativity, and dynamism are invaluable assets that can propel India towards unprecedented growth and development. However, to fully harness their potential, it is crucial to address the challenges they face and create an environment that empowers them. As India strides towards becoming a global leader, the role of the youth becomes ever more critical. They are not just the future of India, but they are also shaping its present, and it is upon us to ensure they have the tools and opportunities they need to thrive.</dd>
